WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) international company has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year, 
and they asked us to analyze the MTA data, to distribute their teams among the top stations in New York to collect as much 
signatures as possible. 


 1.	Data acquisition
We chose the data of two months May and August 2019 from 
2.	Data Cleansing
To prepare the data before processing it,
we striped out all the white space, dealt with missing values, and calculated the exact number of exits and entries. 

3.	Descriptive Analysis & Data Visualization 

Firstly, we calculated the average traffic in each station, and we sorted five top stations in May and August.

   



Then, we calculated the average traffic per hour in weekends and weekdays.
   

Lastly, we suggested the top five stations in May and August also the preferable hours during weekend and weekdays. 
So far, the project was so challenging, yet, I enjoyed every minute working on it.
I have learned how to use Pandas and Seaborn and apply them in my project.
