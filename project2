# Predicting TV Series Ratings

# Purpose:
Being able to predict the rating of TV series before its release. So, it will *strong* attract audiences *strong* and increase the chance of its *strong* success *strong*. From a business perspective, it will *strong* attract advertisers *strong* to promote their products during the stream of the series.

# Features:

I chose the following features because I thought that they represent TV series well. Features are duration, votes, genres and released year.

# Model Process:

*strong* - Web scrapping *strong*
By using beautiful soup tool, I web scraped IMDB website and acquired 1000 TV series.
2- Data cleaning
In this step I dropped all *strong* NaN *strong* rows and removed TV Series with *strong* zero *strong* Votes using Pandas as a tool.
 
*strong* -Model Training and Validation *strong*
Firstly, I split off the data for testing. Then, Create a baseline Model and the score was R^2 = .099, the score is low, for this reason, I started doing feature engineering and build other models and compare them with my baseline. Lastly, I Validated the most suitable models.

*strong* -Feature engineering *strong*
I power transformed my target and figures below show residual plot before and after.


*strong*  -Testing *strong* 
Tested best performing models, and I chose linear regression as my model with *strong*  R^2 = 0.29. *strong* 


Notable Coefficients

# Results:
I concluded that a documentary TV series have a high probability of being highly rated. Also, that duration has a negative correlation with ratings, meaning the less the duration the more the rate.
